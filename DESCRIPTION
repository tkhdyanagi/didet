Description: Difference-in-differences is a powerful causal inference method.
    This package provides tools for difference-in-differences estimation 
    when the treatment variable of interest may be non-binary 
    and its value may change in each time period.
    The methods are developed by Yanagi (2023)<10.48550/arXiv.2212.13226>.
